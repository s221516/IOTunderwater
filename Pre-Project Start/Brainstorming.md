Dear ____, 

We are 3 students on our 3rd year of bachelor's, Felipe, Morten & Mathias. We have all been students in your course _________ and really liked it. We have started to think about our bachelor's project and would like to hear if possibly, you could consider being our supervisor in case we somehow together could find an interesting project. 

Hence, we would like to know if you are in position of some interesting projects that you would like to be started / further developed. 

We are not fixated on any form of specific project, however, starting early we were thinking that we could potentially start early understanding some foundations s.t. the project can start more smoothly at the beginnning. 

Best regards, 
Mathias, Felipe & Morten

Dear [Name],

We are three third-year studentsâ€”Felipe, Morten, and Mathiasâ€”and weâ€™ve all attended your course, [Course Name], which we greatly enjoyed. As we begin thinking about our bachelorâ€™s project, we wanted to reach out and ask if you might consider supervising us, especially if we can work together to find a project with interests in common.

We would also like to know if you have any ongoing or potential projects that you believe could benefit from further development or exploration. We are open to a wide range of topics and are not fixed on any specific project idea at the moment.

Our aim is to get an early start so that we can understand some foundational concepts in advance and ensure a smoother beginning when the time comes to officially kick off the project.

Thank you for considering our request. We look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,  
Mathias, Felipe, and Morten
