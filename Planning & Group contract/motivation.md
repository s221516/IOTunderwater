### Project Plan and Motivation

**Motivation**: As a society humankind has become more and more connected through the Internet of Things (IoT) across the entire globe on the surface and in space. IoT improves daily life in a wide area of industries: healthcare, industrial connection, Harbor, Cisco, wearables etc., In total the entire industry is expected to reach a market cap of $1.06tn USD in 2025. However, only a minor portion of the market resides in IoT working below the water. Improvements in these technologies would facilitate continuous monitoring of the oceans in a cheap and reliable manner, safe ship-wreck surveys, pipeline repair, military surveillance etc.

Thus, in our project we aim to facilitate a new test-bed in academia that will help kickstart new projects in research of underwater IoT communication i.e. send a picture through the water with acoustic waves.
