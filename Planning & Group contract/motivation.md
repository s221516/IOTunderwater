### Motivation

Society has become increasingly connected through the Internet of Things (IoT), linking devices and systems across the globe, both on the ground and in space. IoT improves daily life in a wide area of industries: healthcare, industrial connection, Harbor, Cisco, wearables etc., In total the entire industry is expected to reach a market cap of $1.06tn USD in 2025. However, only a small portion of this market is focused on IoT applications in underwater environments. Advancements in the technology could enable continuous and cost-effective monitoring of the oceans, facilitate safe shipwreck surveys, support pipeline repairs, enhance military surveillance, and more.

In this context, our project aim to facilitate a test-bed that will help projects in research of underwater IoT communication.
