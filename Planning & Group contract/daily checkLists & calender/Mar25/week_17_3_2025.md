# Task Checklist (Week of 17/3/2025)

**Monday (17/3/2025) - DTU day**

- [ ] Felipe + Mathias does DB4
- [ ] Morten did some testing with conv encoding - maybe we need to rethink how to properly do a preable, as this is our current bottleneck
- [ ] Maybe we should update our project plan to better match what we are doing
- [ ] Decide when we want to go test in the pool

**Tuesday (18/3/2025) - DTU**

- [ ] Morten has updateed the preamble -> the new one however does not work with covolutional encoding -> but the amount of bit errors could maybe also be fixed using another encoding scheme, updates will follow
  - [ ] Theory (almost confirmed) -> white space in messages makes them more unreliable -> understand why this is the case
  - [X] Finished most of the writing on the new preamble method
- [ ] Felipe working on DB4
- [ ] Mathias working

**Wednesday (19/3/2025) - DTU**

- [ ] Morten will try to implement a more simple encoding scheme -> if that doesnt happen, understand why conv encoding doesnt work
