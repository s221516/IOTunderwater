- [ ] Writing and Mathias will do some testing
- [ ] .
- [ ] .

**Tuesday (29/4/2025)**

- [ ] Do a test where we take a short distance of both the SG and ESP to really see how far we can cranck up the bit rate
- [ ] Do a test (maybe 70 cm, with BER basically 0, 12000 hz, 100 bps) -> then decrease the amplitude on the SG to see how little amplitude we need here
- [ ] Do a test (maybe 70 cm, with BER basically 0, 12000 hz, 100 bps) -> increase the payload size to see how big it is when it fails

**Wednesday (30/4/2025)**

- [ ] PRESENTATION FOR FLETCHER @ 10:00

**Friday (2/5/2025)**

- [ ] LAB MEETING @ 11
- [ ] Maybe move the transmitter -> somehow be able to finally conclude that the problem is the pool
- [ ] Show statistical differences (error bars)
- [ ] Bit buffering, somehow guarantee that the data bits doesnt have a correlation of 9, but we would still be able to send it
