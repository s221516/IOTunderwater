# Task Checklist (Week of 21/4/2025)

**Monday (21/4/2025)**

- [ ] All was off - we enjoyed life
- [ ] .
- [ ] .

**Tuesday (22/4/2025)**

- [ ] Felipe and Morten it does some physical writing - Mathias has done some proof reading with some comments, well done :)
- [ ] .

**Wednesday (23/4/2025)**

- [ ] Write, write, write, write, write, write
- [ ] .
- [ ] .

**Thursday (24/4/2025)**

- [ ] Mathias and Morten will merge the files together, then no code can be updated anymore -> only to refactor, so we can do some tests with ESP also
- [ ] Figure out where to describe our test setups so they can be repoduced
- [ ] .

**Friday (25/4/2025)**

- [ ] Meeting @ 11 with Harris on Zoom
- [ ] Write about stage 3 -> talk about the usecase -> make a remark about ESP's being bad -> protocol: we havnt taken care of edge cases, where both chatters send a message at the same time, both will block their own receiver and therby no-one will get a message, but thats okay
- [ ] Refactor codebase
- [ ] Notes from meeting
  - [ ] Make the BER a function of the bit rate, distance, amplitude, carrier frequency, maybe tempeture, depth
  - [ ] Determine what we evaluate as being a valid BER
  - [ ] Resonanse, multipath -> give a logical response
  - [ ] Instead of always hello there -> make a random bit string, both with random characters and different lengths
  - [ ] are the bit errors always in the same spots ->  save the wav.files -> are the BER favored towards either 1 or 0 -> do most happen from 1 to 0 or from 0 to 1 -> its easier to do analysis with the raw data than just the, so save it in a ordered way.
  - [ ] do more than 50 recordings -> less variying of many different parameters
  - [ ] find a good starting spot with the signal generator then check if the ESP can do the same
  - [ ] easy conclusion for evalution: imaging the experiements work well for both the SG and ESP. Imagine you send 10 messages everyday and calculate how much energy / power you are actually saving by using the ESP -> For SG: how much time and look at oscciloscope. For ESP: using microcontoller check how much power you are using from the data sheet, multiply by messages -> assuming when you dont transmit you go to deep sleep -> consuming less power
  - [ ] if you want to use IoT you have to talk about low-power, that is what it is all about -> mention how amplitude modulation is not the most power efficent modulation scheme (put this in discussion, "we know from litterature, these modulation shecems uses less power" -> same goes for BER with amplitude modulation
