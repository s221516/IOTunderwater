# Task Checklist (Week of 7/4/2025)

**Monday (7/4/2025) - DTU day**

- [ ] Morten will do some intermediate data handling from all the tests, and do some writing
  - [X] Made some great plots + made conv encoding work (Thanks Mathias <3)
    - [ ] Make new test for conv encoding -> preamble theory might not be true, it was prolly just bad chat implementation (my bad) -> looking forward to make it good B-)
    - [ ] Talk about how to continue the testing in the pool -> how to implement encoding in a meaningful way
    - [ ] Make a test to verify the specs of the microphone -> is it sensitive on the tip ;) or all the way around -> somehow tests it efficiency range (even when limited by the speaker?)
    - [ ] Could make more tests to compare depth
    - [ ] Make test about moving mircrophone
    - [ ] Make presentation for Fletchers course on Wednesday morning (8-12, we can come any time and say anything we want B-))
- [ ] .

**Tuesday (8/4/2025)**

- [X] Write mail to Fletcher that we will come after easter
- [ ] Make a test in the pool with distance 40 and 70 cm with 6000 hz to determine whether the plastic tank / pool is different / comparable
- [ ] Felipe is the goat -> made ESP with dac work -> got a clean Hello there through -> the fact that we can now amplify our signal and is no longer reliant on the weak signal generator
  - [ ] Determine how to make effective tets work in the pool -> we whould be able to get way better signal through with this amount of sound :)
- [ ] Next step: make both ESP work -> make the AquaChat
- [ ] Next step: figure out an efficient way of testing in pool
- [ ] Figure out how to make the ESP use less power -> cool thing is that the only thing you need to make this work in the real world is an ESP B-)
- [ ] Also, how to make the recieverClass less reliant on the len_of_data_bits variable

**Wednesday (9/4/2025)**

- [ ] Felipe and Morten will do some writing
- [ ] Figure out how to do some data analysis with Eb/No (normalized signal to noise ratio energy per bit to spectral noice density) to compare the bit error rates of our encoding schemes
- [ ] .

**Thursday (10/4/2025)**

- [ ] When using ESP, make a script that starts recording when sound is detected instead of having to maunally record it and time it
- [ ] Show Morten how to use the ESP and connect the wires
