Base propagation speed for acoustic waves underwater: 1500 m/s, this increases with 4 m/s per second by 1 degree of celcius	

Most common issues in relation to underwater acoustic communication

- Signal propagation energy loses, absorption and scattering loss
- Man-made and ambient noise
- Attenuation, where the acoustic energy is transformed into heat energy and absorbtion losses
- Path and multipath loses from degradation of the waves which generates ISI (inter-symbol interference) (one symbol interferes with subsequent symbols)
- Doppler shift
