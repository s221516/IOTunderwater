To Do:
- Investigate easy programable solution to output all kind of waves - test with arduino uno maybe (Felipe).
- Investigate how to connect to signal generator and osciloscope to computer - ask for cables
- meld til kursus
- Fix github, sÃ¥ Lister ikke findes

StepX:
- How do to modulate a carrier wave? 

Step2: (mostly understood)
- Geneartor - what dooes the generator actually output? Is it a match?
- Speaker - what does 8 ohm and 30 Watt means. And how does it relate to signal generator. 
- In general what should work? Big paper  


To buy:
- (ekstra amplifier)


Finished steps
------
Step 1: Base case test Done 2/5: 
- test0: O + wave generator *check()
- test1: O + med hydrophone *check()
- test2: Speaker + wave generator (spil sinus waves) 
- base test: Wave generator + speaker -> hydrophone + O


Have bought:
- find PA6 phantom powered hydophone preamp (adapter from hydrophone) (Morten knows)
- ekstra kasse, cuz we scared 
- adapter
