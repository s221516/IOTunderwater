"What can a collaborator do in GitHub?
Collaborators on a personal repository can pull (read) the contents of the repository and push (write) changes to the repository. In a private repository, repository owners can only grant write access to collaborators. Collaborators can't have read-only access to repositories owned by a personal account."

2) add it to github
